# Garden Center Preorder Playbook
*Based on the Retail Savage Framework for Identity-Driven Commerce*

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS MODEL

### Core Philosophy: Identity-Driven Preorders
We don't sell plants because we have inventory. We create preorder campaigns that allow customers to express their gardening identity and aspirations. Each drop is a chance to belong to an exclusive community of garden enthusiasts.

### Key Business Metrics
- **Primary Goal**: Drive identity and belonging through exclusive preorder access
- **Attach Rate Target**: 25-40% at pickup (industry-leading is 40%+)
- **Average Attach Value**: $85 per pickup transaction
- **Pickup Conversion**: Transform logistics into a second sales opportunity
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: 3+ years through seasonal habit creation

### Weekly Drop Strategy
```
Monday: Tease upcoming drop (email/SMS to VIPs)
Wednesday: Early access launch (top 20% customers)
Thursday: General launch with urgency messaging
Friday-Saturday: Peak engagement window
Sunday: Last chance messaging
Monday: Waitlist opens for sold-out items
```
